            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hi my name is Jason, I am student in Vancouver and this is my first website. As of now I have been learning how to write in html and css and hope to expand my knowledge as a programmer. 
            <p>I hope that the links help you understand what a website is and some of the things that go into developing a website or maybe inspire you to start your own journey to becoming a programmer.</p>
            <h2>My Hobbies</h2>
            <p>I personally really enjoy playing sports and just moving my body. I started out playing soccer then moved on to basketball for a few years and even joined my school team, but over the past 2 years I have been getting into volleyball Iâ€™ve joined my school team and even won a championship.</p>
