        <h2>Git / GitHub</h2>
        <p>
            GitHub is a code hosting platform for collaboration. It lets you and others work together on projects from anywhere.
            Team members can work on files and easily merge their changes in with the master branch of the project by pushing and pulling files form github.
        </p>

        <p>
            Git is a type of system that makes it easier to track changes to files. For example, when you edit a file, git can help you determine exactly what changed, who changed it, and why.
        </p>
        <p>
            You would use terminal and list of commmands to add those files to commit. You could think of adding files to commit as adding things into a basket. 
            Then you would push those files onto github like sending the basket onto a shelf where you can also pull files down. 
        </p>
        <h2>Steps:</h2>
        <p>
           Let's say you have been working on your first website and want to push all the files to github.
        </p>
        <h3>Terminal:</h3>
        <img class="screenshot-terminal" src="../../../images/terminal.png" alt="image of terminal adding to commit">
        <h2>List of Commands Used:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>ls "to list folders and files"</li>
            <li>cd MyFirstWebsite "file you want to commit"</li>
            <li>git add . "to add all the files to the commit"</li>
            <li>git commit -m "type message in quoutations"</li>
            <li>git log "to see the all the commited files and folders" </li>
            <li>git push "to push all the files and folders to gitgub"</li>
            <li>clear "to clear everything"</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            First I typed "ls" to list all the folders in my home tab. Next I typed "cd workspace" change directory to go into the folder workspace.
            Then "cd MyfirstWebsite" change directory into that folder. Then "ls" to  list everything in that folder. I then typed "git add ." to add all the files to commit.
            Next I typed "git status" to see everything that i'm going to commit as you can see the "changes to be committed:". You will also have to put a message for the commit in quoutations for all the files and modified files. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Finally I would type in the command "git push" to push the files to github. In a few seconds the files would be pushed into your repository where
            other people can pull your changes.
